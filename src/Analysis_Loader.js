      <p>Abinadi was a prophet who preached about the coming of Christ and was put to death by King Noah and his people (Mosiah 11–17). He taught that salvation comes through Christ and taught about redemption from sins and death through the suffering, death, and resurrection of the son of God. Abinadi’s teachings were recorded by Alma I, a former priest of King Noah who was converted by the prophet’s testimony (Mosiah 17:4).  <br/><br/> Redemption is an important theme in Abinadi’s teaching. Isaiah uses words for redeem more than any other Book of Mormon speaker: “Redeemed” (Isaiah 52:9). Abinadi uses the word “redeem” (Mosiah 13:33; 15:1, 11–12, 27) and “redeemeth” (Mosiah 15:26; 16:2), and speaks of those who are “redeemed” (Mosiah 15:9, 18, 23–24, 27, 30; 16:4). He also uses the word “redemption” (Mosiah 13:32; 15:19; 16:5, 6, 15). He uses the phrase, “I say unto you” eight times more than every other Book of Mormon speaker combined.  <br/><br/> Words uniquely used by Abinadi include “beguile” (1), “cuts” (1), “disowned” (1), “endlessly (1), “gnash” (1), “persists” (1), “goes” (1), “pretend” (1), “works whether they be good or whether they be evil” (1), and “he that persists in his own carnal nature, and goes on in the ways of sin” (1).  <br/><br/> Abinadi uses the titles “eternal father” and “eternal father of heaven and earth,” as do several other Book of Mormon prophets, but his reference to Christ as “the very eternal father” is unique. Two references to Christ that are only used by Abinadi are, “a life which is endless” and “a light that is endless” (Mosiah 16:9). Abinadi is also the only Book of Mormon speaker to use the title, “founder of peace”. It is interesting to consider the possibility that the title may be a wordplay upon the name Jerusalem, which appears in the passage Noah’s priests ask Abinadi to interpret (Isaiah 52:9; Mosiah 12:23). While there is uncertainty among scholars as to the precise meaning of the name, some have interpreted it to mean something like “foundation of peace.”<sup>1</sup> <br/><br/> The phrase “the bands of death” is statistically significant for Abinadi. He is 70.8% more likely to use the term than any other Book of Mormon speaker. It is possible that some of Abinadi’s resurrection teaching draws upon Isaiah’s reference to Zion being told to “arise” from the dust, having her “bands” removed, and being clothed in glorious apparel (Isaiah 52:1–2).  <br/><br/> <strong>Reversal of the Exodus</strong> <br/><br/> The first time Abinadi preached to the people of King Noah, he prophesied that if they did not repent, they would be brought into bondage. His words evoke those of the Lord to Moses during his call to deliver Israel out of Egypt (Exodus 3:7–9, 16–17), but are used in a way that convey, for Noah’s people, a dramatic reversal of the Exodus (Mosiah 11:20). The Lord told Moses, “I have <b><i>seen</i></b> the affliction of my people” and “<b><i>seen</i></b> the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them” and “<b><i>seen</i></b> that which is done to you in Egypt.” Through Abinadi, the Lord tells Noah and his people, “I have <b><i>seen</i></b> their abominations, and their wickedness and their whoredoms” (Mosiah 11:20; also compare what the Lord says of Jerusalem: 1 Nephi 1:13; Jeremiah 13:27).  <br/><br/> The Lord told Moses he had “<b><i>heard</i></b> their cry by reason of their taskmasters” and would come down “to <b><i>deliver them out</i></b> of the hand of the Egyptians.” The Lord told Noah and his people that he would “<b><i>deliver them into</i></b> the hands of their enemies” and that they would be “brought <b><i>into</i></b> bondage” (Mosiah 11:21). In contrast to Israel in Egypt, “I will be <b><i>slow to hear</i></b> their cries” and “<b><i>I will not hear</i></b> their prayers, <b><i>neither will I deliver them out</i></b> of their afflictions” unless they repent (Mosiah 11:24–25). The Lord told Moses and Israel, “I have surely <b><i>visited</i></b> you” to deliver them from Egypt. The Lord told Abinadi, “I will <b><i>visit</i></b> them in mine anger” (Mosiah 11:20).  <br/><br/> God said to ancient Israel, “ye shall <b><i>know that I am the Lord your God</i></b>” (Exodus 6:7). Of Noah and his people, he said, “they shall <b><i>know that I am the Lord their God</i></b>” (Mosiah 11:22). When the Lord gave the Ten Commandments he warned, “I am a jealous God, <b><i>visiting the iniquity</i></b> of the fathers upon the children” (Exodus 20:5). To Noah’s people he said, “They shall know that I am a jealous God, <b><i>visiting the iniquities</i></b> of my people” (Mosiah 11:22).  <br/><br/> Noah’s words, “<b><i>Who</i></b> is Abinadi that I and my people should be <b><i>judged</i></b> of him?” echo those of the ungrateful Israelite who asked Moses, “<b><i>Who</i></b> made thee a prince and a <b><i>judge</i></b> over us?” (Exodus 2:14). When King Noah asks, “<b><i>Who is the Lord</i></b> that shall bring upon my people such great affliction?” he is like Pharaoh who asked, “<b><i>Who is the Lord</i></b> that I should obey his voice to let Israel go?” (Exodus 5:2), and like Pharaoh, “<b><i>hardened</i></b> his heart” (Mosiah 11:29; compare Exodus 7:13). The wickedness and sin of King Noah and his people is characterized in Abinadi’s prophecy as a form of bondage, and the reversal of the blessing of deliverance in Exodus becomes a curse of greater bondage and affliction if the people refuse to repent.  <br/><br/> Abinadi’s second mission, after the people refuse to repent, continues to use language of the Exodus, placing Noah’s people in the role of rebellious Egypt. Unrepentant Noah, like recalcitrant Pharaoh (Exodus 7:5; 14:4, 18), “<b><i>shall know that I am the Lord</i></b>” (Mosiah 12:3). God told Pharaoh, “I will stretch out my hand, that I may <b><i>smite thee and thy people with pestilence</i></b>; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth” (Exodus 9:14-15). The Lord told Noah’s people, “I will <b><i>smite this my people</i></b> with sore afflictions, yea, with famine and with <b><i>pestilence</i></b>” and that, “except they repent I will utterly destroy them” (Mosiah 12:4, 7–8). Both are smitten with “<b><i>hail</i></b>”(Exodus 9:22; Mosiah 12:6), the “<b><i>east wind</i></b>,” and insects that will pester the land and devour their crops (Exodus 8:16-24; Mosiah 12:6).  <br/><br/> In Egypt, Moses took ashes from the furnace, sprinkled them toward heaven, and the Egyptians were cursed with boils and blains (Exodus 9:10). Israel, however, was promised that if they would diligently hearken to God, “I will put none of these <b><i>diseases</i></b> which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee” (Exodus 15:26; see also Deuteronomy 28:60). When Abinadi is suffering death by fire, he tells the priests, “Ye shall be afflicted with all manner of <b><i>diseases</i></b> because of your iniquities” (Mosiah 17:14–16). When the Lord’s people break their covenant with God, refuse to repent, and choose to remain in spiritual bondage, he treats them like Egypt.  <br/><br/> <strong>Abinadi’s use of Isaiah</strong> <br/><br/> Those who read Abinadi’s words may wonder how Abinadi’s teachings relate to the words of Isaiah. In his defense before King Noah and his priests, Abinadi is asked to explain the meaning of Isaiah 52:7–10 in light of his negative prophecies about them and the people. In response, Abinadi expounds upon this passage, but also expands his use of Isaiah’s words to include parts of Isaiah that surround the passage in question. Readers of Abinadi’s words can be rewarded by noting key words and phrases that are used by both prophets. Several significant themes can be identified by readers who read Mosiah 12–16 in light of Isaiah 49–53.  <br/><br/> Passages from Isaiah and Abinadi refer to “his people” and “my people.” <i>Who</i> are the Lord’s people? Both Isaiah and Abinadi make clear that it is those who trust in him, “hearken” and “give ear” to his law and commandments (Isaiah 51:1, 4, 5, 7; Mosiah 15:11), and “in whose heart is my law” (Isaiah 51:7). Abinadi seems to reference this passage when, after noting the priests’ refusal to keep the Law of Moses, he cites the Ten Commandments, “for I perceive that they are not written in your hearts” (Mosiah 13:11). Abinadi, however, seemingly references the version of the passage on the small plates of Nephi rather than the one from our current Bible, which reads “in whose heart I have <b><i>written</i></b> my law” (2 Nephi 8:7).  <br/><br/> Another important teaching from Isaiah that Abinadi draws upon is that those who trust in God need not fear death because the Lord’s blessing of salvation will be forever. Although the flesh shall wax old and die, the blessing of righteousness made possible through the Lord’s righteous servant (Christ), will continue (Isaiah 51:6–8). As a “life that is endless,” Christ brings “eternal life” to his people by raising his people from death to glory (Isaiah 52:1–2; Mosiah 15:23–24).  <br/><br/> Christ suffered and bore the transgressions of his people (those who hearken) and makes “intercession” for them (Isaiah 53:12; Mosiah 15:8–9). Isaiah says the Lord “pleadeth the cause of his people” (Isaiah 51:22). This intercession is available to those who hearken, but can be refused by those who rebel and go on in the way of sin (Mosiah 15:26–27; 16:5, 12). Notably, Noah’s priests, who reject him who was familiar with infirmities and sicknesses (Isaiah 53:3–4), are ironically “smitten with all manner of diseases because of their iniquities” (Mosiah 17:16).  <br/><br/> Below are possible examples that may help the reader see where Abinadi may be drawing upon Isaiah’s words, phrases, and ideas.  <br/><br/> <strong>Isaiah 49</strong> <br/><br/> “My servant to <b><i>raise up</i></b> the tribes of Jacob, and <b><i>restore</i></b> the preserved of Israel” (Isaiah 49:6). “They are <b><i>raised</i></b> ... And thus the Lord bringeth about the <b><i>restoration</i></b> of these; and they have part in the first resurrection” (Mosiah 15:23–24).  <br/><br/> “I will give thee for a <b><i>light</i></b> to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth” (Isaiah 49:6). “He is ... a <b><i>light</i></b> that is endless” (Mosiah 16:9).  <br/><br/> “I will save thy <b><i>children</i></b>” (Isaiah 49:25). “And little <b><i>children</i></b> also have eternal life” (Mosiah 15:25).  <br/><br/> <strong>Isaiah 50</strong> <br/><br/> “Who is mine adversary?” (Isaiah 50:8). “Enemy to God” (Mosiah 16:5).  <br/><br/> “I was not rebellious” (Isaiah 50:5). “Rebel,” “wilfully rebel against God” (Mosiah 15:26), “rebellion” (Mosiah 16:5).  <br/><br/> <strong>Isaiah 51</strong> <br/><br/> “Hearken” (Isaiah 51:1,4,7). “Hearkened” (Mosiah 15:11), “would not hearken” (Mosiah 16:2).  <br/><br/> “Look” (Isaiah 51:2). “Looked forward to that day” (Mosiah 15:11).  <br/><br/> “For a <b><i>law</i></b> shall proceed from me” (Isaiah 51:4). “If ye teach the <b><i>Law of Moses</i></b> why do you not keep it?” (Mosiah 12:29). “It is expedient that ye should keep the <b><i>Law of Moses</i></b> as yet; but I say unto you, that the time shall come when it shall no more be expedient to keep the <b><i>Law of Moses</i></b>” (Mosiah 13:27).  <br/><br/> “And I will make my judgement to rest for a <b><i>light</i></b> of the people” (Isaiah 51:4). “He is the <b><i>light</i></b> ... a <b><i>light</i></b> that is endless that can never be darkened” (Mosiah 16:9).  <br/><br/> “My salvation is gone forth, and mine <b><i>arms </i></b>shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine <b><i>arm</i></b> shall they trust” (Isaiah 51:5)“For the <b><i>arms</i></b> of mercy were extended towards them, and they would not” (Mosiah 16:12).  <br/><br/> “<b><i>His people</i></b>” (Isaiah 51:22). “<b><i>His people</i></b>” Mosiah 15:5, 11, 18; 16:4).  <br/><br/> “In whose <b><i>heart</i></b> is my <b><i>law</i></b>” (Isaiah 51:7). Jacob cites same passage from Isaiah “in whose <b><i>heart</i></b> is <b><i>written</i></b> my <b><i>law</i></b>” (2 Nephi 8:7). Noah’s priests do not keep the <b><i>Law of Moses</i></b> (Mosiah 12:29), so Abinadi reads them the Ten Commandments because “I perceive that they are not <b><i>written</i></b> in your <b><i>hearts</i></b>” (Mosiah 13:11).  <br/><br/> “<b><i>Foundations</i></b> of the earth” (Isaiah 51:13, 16). “Prepared from the <b><i>foundation</i></b> of the world” (Mosiah 15:19).  <br/><br/> “The cup of trembling” (Isaiah 51:17, 22). “Tremble” (Mosiah 15:27; 16:13).  <br/><br/> “<b><i>Famine</i></b>,” “destruction” (Isaiah 51:19). “<b><i>Famine</i></b>” (Mosiah 12:4), “destroy them” (Mosiah 12:8).  <br/><br/> <strong>Isaiah 52:7-10</strong> <br/><br/> “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation” (Isaiah 52:7; Abinadi’s interpretation, Mosiah 15:14–18).  <br/><br/> “Thy God reigneth!” (Isaiah 52:7). “The Son reigneth” (Mosiah 15:20).  <br/><br/> “Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion. Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem. The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of God” (Isaiah 52:8-10; Abinadi’s interpretation, Mosiah 15:28–Mosiah 16:1–2).  <br/><br/> “Redeemed” (Isaiah 52:9). Abinadi uses the word “redeem” (13:33; 15:1, 11–12, 27), “redeemeth” (Mosiah 15:26; 16:2), and speaks of those who are “redeemed” (Mosiah 15:9, 18, 23–24, 27, 30; 16:4). He also uses the word “redemption” (Mosiah 13:32; 15:19; 16:5–6, 15).  <br/><br/> <strong>Isaiah 52:1-6, 11</strong> <br/><br/> “<b><i>Bands</i></b>” (Isaiah 52:2). “<b><i>Bands</i></b> of death” (Mosiah 15:8–9, 20, 23).  <br/><br/> “<b><i>Depart</i></b>” (Isaiah 52:11). “They would not <b><i>depart</i></b>” (Mosiah 16:12).  <br/><br/> “They that rule over them make them to <b><i>howl</i></b>” (Isaiah 52:5). “I will cause that they shall <b><i>howl</i></b> all the day long” (Mosiah 12:4); “they shall have cause to <b><i>howl</i></b>” (Mosiah 16:2).  <br/><br/> “Shake thyself from the dust, <b><i>arise</i></b>” (Isaiah 52:2). “They are the first resurrection. They are <b><i>raised</i></b> to dwell with God” (Mosiah 15:22–23).  <br/><br/> <strong>Isaiah 53</strong> <br/><br/> “Who hath <b><i>believed</i></b> our report?” (Isaiah 53:1). “All those who have hearkened unto their words and <b><i>believed</i></b>” (Mosiah 15:11, 22).  <br/><br/> “<b><i>As a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth</i></b>” (Isaiah 53:7; Mosiah 15:6).  <br/><br/> “<b><i>My people</i></b>” (Isaiah 53:8; 51:4, 16; 52:4, 6). “<b><i>My people</i></b>” (Mosiah 14:8).  <br/><br/> “He shall see his seed” (Isaiah 53:10; Abinadi’s interpretation, Mosiah 15:10–13).  <br/><br/> “<b><i>Intercession</i></b>” (Isaiah 53:12). “<b><i>Intercession</i></b>” (Mosiah 15:8).  <br/><br/> “He was wounded for our <b><i>transgressions</i></b>, he was bruised for our <b><i>iniquities</i></b>” (Isaiah 53:5). “Taken upon himself their <b><i>iniquity</i></b> and their <b><i>transgressions</i></b>” (Mosiah 15:9).  <br/><br/> “Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief” (“Yet it was the <b><i>will</i></b> of the Lord to crush him with pain” Isaiah 53:10 NRSV); “The pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand” (Isaiah 53:10; “Through him the <b><i>will</i></b> of the Lord shall prosper” NRSV). “… The <b><i>will</i></b> of the Son being swallowed up in the <b><i>will</i></b> of the Father” (Mosiah 15:7). Abinadi contrasts the subjugation of the Son’s will to the Father with that of the wicked and miserable “having gone according to <b><i>their own carnal wills</i></b>” (Mosiah 16:12).  <br/><br/> “He <b><i>bare</i></b> the <b><i>sin</i></b> of many” (Isaiah 53:12). “Whose <b><i>sins</i></b> he has <b><i>borne</i></b>” (Mosiah 15:12).  <br/><br/> “He shall see the travail of his soul and shall be <b><i>satisfied</i></b>” (Isaiah 53:11). “<b><i>Satisfied</i></b> the demands of justice” (Mosiah 15:9).  <br/><br/> <br/> <sup>1</sup> F.

      <p>       Alma II was the son of Alma I who organized the Church of Christ among the people of King Noah in the land of Nephi. In his earlier life Alma had been a wicked man but was converted to Christ after the miraculous intervention of an angel of God (Mosiah 27:8-37. King Mosiah entrusted him with the sacred archive of Nephite records (Mosiah 28:20). Following the death of his father Alma became High Priest over the Church. Alma also served as the first Chief Judge over the people of Nephi for eight years after which he voluntarily gave up the judgment seat to spend the remainder of his life preaching the Gospel (Alma 4:16-19).<br/><br/>Alma refers to God’s plan 18 times, more than any other single speaker and more than all other speakers combined. His most common phrase is the “plan of redemption” (11 times), “plan of salvation” (once), “plan of restoration” (once), “plan of happiness” (2 times), and “plan of mercy” (3 times). The last three phrases are only used by him.<br/><br/>Alma uses the word “spirit” primarily in reference to the Spirit of God, or the gift which come from Him, “the Spirit” (11 times), “Spirit of God” (7 times), “Holy Spirit” (4 times), “spirit of prophecy” (4 times), “spirit of revelation” (4 times), Spirit of the Lord” (3 times), “born of the Spirit” (once), “his Spirit” (once), spirit of the truth” (once), as opposed to the “spirit of the soul” of man (once), or that of the adversary, “spirit of the devil” (once), “lying spirit” (once).<br/><br/>With two exceptions(1) all references to spiritual rebirth in the Book of Mormon are from Alma’s testimony and teachings. These include the phrases “born of God” (8 times), “born again” (4 times), and “born of the Spirit” (once). The last phrase is unique to Alma.<br/><br/>He uses the phrase “it came to pass” only about one-eleventh as often and the word king only about one-eighth as often as the rest of the Book of Mormon.<br/><br/>Alma’s use of the noun “state” to refer to the various conditions of the soul (35 times) is significant.(2) This about ten times as much as any other writer. Alma’s use of this word is often concentrated within a cluster of verses in his sermons. In his teachings to Corianton they occur 9 times in Alma 40:11-15, 6 times in Alma 41:11-12, and 6 times in Alma 42:10-13. Alma also uses the term state to reword various conditions. He first speaks of mortality as a probationary “time” (Alma 42:4) and then rewords this as a probationary “state” (Alma 42:10, 13). The people of Zarahemla were in an “awful dilemma” (Alma 7:3) which he then rewords as a “state of dilemma” (Alma 7:18). When he discusses the principle of agency Alma, in contrast to Lehi (2 Nephi 2:26-28) and Jacob (2 Nephi 10:23), or Samuel (Helaman 14:30-31), describes man as being placed in a “state to act” as opposed to simply being “free” or “free to choose.” This usage also distinguishes Alma from discussions of agency in the revelations of the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price (Doctrine and Covenants 29:35-39; 58:27-28; 93:30-31; 107:78; Moses 6:56).<br/><br/>In his counsel to his son Corianton Alma draws upon the teachings of the prophet Abinadi.(3) It had been Alma’s own father who had heard, believed, and recorded the teachings of that prophet (Mosiah 17:2; 18:1-3).<br/><br/>In nearly every recorded sermon Alma alludes to elements from his conversion experience. As S. Kent Brown observes:<br/><br/></p>
      <p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
        That anxiety for the eternal welfare of others was clearly based in the memory and knowledge of his own past experience of turning back from the edge of misery and self-destruction to partake of the joyful fruit of the tree of life (Alma 36:24).

      <p>Ammon was one of the sons of king Mosiah.  He, his brothers, and Alma had once been part of a faction which sought to destroy the Church of God.  He and his brothers converted after the miraculous intervention of an angel (Mosiah 27:8-37).  He spent the remainder of his life in the service of God.  He led his brethren on a fourteen-year mission to the land of Nephi, resulting in the conversion of thousands of Lamanites (Alma 17:1-4).  His example among that people was a model of faith, selfless service, and love which had a lasting impact on the people of Nephi for generations.  When these converts were in danger of genocide at the hands of unbelievers, he led them back to the land of Zarahemla, where they were permitted to settle under Nephite protection (Alma 27:1-26).  He continued to live among that people and serve as a high priest (Alma 30:20-21).  With the prophet Alma and several of his brothers, he also joined the mission to Antionum to help reclaim a group of Zoramite dissenters (Alma 31:6).<br/><br/>Ammon’s favorite words include “brethren” (19), “my brethren” (9), “power” (8), “things” (8), “flocks” (7), “joy” (7), “of God” (7), “the Lord” (7).  He always mentions power as a gift from God, rather than worldly power over others.  His use of the word “brethren” seems to underscore the love he has for the Lamanites and his fellow missionaries.  Words for God, joy, love, and blessed reflect the happiness of a humble and successful missionary.  Only Ammon uses the words “fellow servants” (2), “marvelings” (2), “bounty” (1), “brim” (1), “comprehendeth” (1), “consign” (1), “defended” (1), “dwells” (1), “garners” (1), “laughed” )1), “penetrate” (1), “privation” (1), “sickle” (1), “sleepeth” (1), “smallest” (1).  The word “reason” is 40 times more likely to be spoken by Ammon than by any other Book of Mormon speaker.  Half of the references to the phrase “joy is full” in the Book of Mormon text are from Ammon.  While other Book of Mormon speakers refer to God’s mercy, Ammon is the only one to refer to God as “a merciful Being” (Alma 26:35).<br/><br/>Ammon’s use of the imagery of the harvest is particularly meaningful.  He is the only Book of Mormon prophet to refer to God as, “Lord of the harvest” (Alma 26:7).  He is the only Lehite prophet to use the word “sheaves,” “sickle,” and “garner. ” The words “reap,” “ripe,” and “field” are used by other Book of Mormon speakers, but Ammon uses those words at a higher rate than anyone else in the Nephite record.  The harvest theme is used by many prophets in scripture, but Ammon’s description of the Lord’s preservation of the sheaves sets him apart from others. <br/><br/>Behold the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the day long did ye labor; and behold the number of your sheaves! And they shall be gathered into the garners, that they are not wasted. <br/><br/>Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them. <br/><br/>But behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest, and they are his; and he will raise them up at the last day (Alma 26:5-7). <br/><br/>The Lord of the Harvest not only knows how to gather his people, but also how to protect, preserve, and seal them up from the power of the enemy.<br/><br/><strong>Sources</strong><br/><br/>Ammon’s description of Lehi’s people as, “a branch of the tree of Israel” that has been “lost from its body in a strange land” (Alma 26:36), seems to draw upon the Zenos Allegory about the house of Israel as an olive tree, whose branches are scattered to different places (Jacob 5:3, 14).<br/><br/>Ammon and the sons of Mosiah had been with Alma at the time the angel appeared.  Ammon’s words show influence from Alma’s description of his conversion.  Alma said, “I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of God” (Mosiah 27:29).  Ammon says, “Our brethren, the Lamanites, were in the darkest abyss, but behold, how many of them are brought to behold the marvelous light of God!” (Alma 26:3).  Ammon is the only Nephite prophet, besides Alma, to use the word “snatch. ” Alma marveled, “The Lord in his mercy hath seen fit to snatch me out of an everlasting burning” (Mosiah 27:28), and “my soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more” (Mosiah 27:29).  Ammon asks his brethren, “Who could have supposed that our God would have been so merciful as to have snatched us from our awful, sinful, and polluted state?” (Alma 26:17).  <br/><br/>Ammon also seems to make use of the earlier language of King Benjamin, his grandfather, who taught that they should believe in God, and, “believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend” (Mosiah 4:9).  Ammon boasted of God, “for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things” (Alma 26:35).  He is also the only Book of Mormon speaker, besides the angel in Benjamin’s speech (Mosiah 3:19), to use the term, “natural man” (Alma 26:21). <br/><br/>Alma’s words reflect the love and empathy he has for those he teaches.  They also paint a picture of a man recognizes God’s miraculous mercy in his life, that of his brethren, and his Lamanite converts.  His language conveys the impression that when he witnessed their conversion, he could not help but think of his own.  When you read Ammon’s words it is helpful to look for words and phrases that point to his recognition of how merciful God can be to those who will repent and place their trust in him. </p>

					<p>Amulek’s testimony of Christ and his Gospel seems rooted in the experience of one who had endured great personal suffering and loss, yet found hope, peace and stability through the plan of salvation. <br/><br/> Amulek was Alma’s companion at the city of Ammonihah, and the later missions to Sidon, and the Zoramite dissenters at Antionum. He had been a man of significant wealth and reputation (Alma 10:1-4). In support of Alma’s prophetic message he testified boldly to the people of his community. He was then arrested and forced to witness the martyrdom of all the women and children who believed in his message, likely including members of his own family (Alma 10:11; 14:8-10). After being forced to witness this terrible sight he was unjustly imprisoned, cruelly abused by his captors but miraculously delivered. Having lost all his former possessions and home, he was rejected by his former friends, kindred, and even his own father (Alma 15:16). Not long after his departure from his former community, the entire population was annihilated. <br/><br/> Unlike some of the other speakers in the Book of Mormon Amulek does not discuss the details or mechanics of Christ’s sufferings. Instead he focused on the superlative magnitude and eternal nature of that atoning sacrifice. Only Amulek uses the phrase “great and last sacrifice” (Alma 34:10:14-15) This act, Amulek emphasizes, was to be “infinite and eternal” (Alma 34:10, 12,14). Apart from Amulek, only Nephi (2 Nephi 25:16) and Jacob (2 Nephi 9:7) referred to the atonement as “infinite.” For Amulek nothing else measures up to the great and last sacrifice of the Son of God.  “No form of human revenge or avenging would ever bring back the lives that were lost in the atrocity of Ammonihah.”(1)  Amulek’s testimony, that the Son of God would provide an infinite atonement with mercy and safety for the repentant while the unrepentant and rebellious would be “exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice” (Alma 34:14-16), would provide comfort and hope in the face of unspeakable loss and sorrow.  <br/><br/> Amulek taught the Zoramites the importance of prayer and of praying in whatever circumstances one may be in. This included the importance of praying for mercy, humility, deliverance from enemies and the power of the devil (Alma 34:17-23). The Lord had answered his and Amulek’s prayers for deliverance (Alma 14:25-29) and how the Lord had mercifully healed Zeezrom after his sincere conversion (Alma 15:3-12). <br/><br/> When Amulek taught the Zoramites about the need for faith and patience, he could also speak from personal tutorials including his long and difficult ordeal in prison where both he and Alma wondered how long they would have to wait and how much they would have to endure before finding deliverance (Alma 14:10-13-26). <br/><br/> The phrase “faith unto repentance (Alma 34:15-17) is unique to Amulek and builds upon Alma’s earlier teachings about planting the seed of faith in Christ as the Son of God. His testimony that the unrepentant “must unavoidably perish” (Alma 34:9), and that the Zoramites should not procrastinate the day of their repentance (Alma 34:35). was founded in witnessed experience years before when members of his own community who spurned and rejected the prophetic message and “did not believe in the repentance of their sins” (Alma 15:15), and were destroyed to a man (Alma 16:9). <br/><br/> Having once been a man of means and reputation who had subsequently lost everything, he could speak of the importance of ministering to the needs of the poor, the needy, the naked and afflicted (Alma 34:28). It had been Amulek, who, at the behest of an angel, had ministered to Alma after he had first been cast out of his city. And later it was Alma who later ministered to Amulek. <br/><br/> </p><p>Amulek, having forsaken all his gold, and silver, and his precious things, which were in the land of Ammonihah, for the word of God, he being rejected by those who were once his friends, and also by his father and his kindred . . . therefore [Alma] took Amulek and came over to the land of Zarahemla, and <em>took him to his own house, and did administer unto him in his tribulations, and strengthened him in the Lord </em> (Alma 15:16, 18).</p><br/><br/><br/> (1) John W.

      <p> King Benjamin was the son of Mosiah I, a righteous king, and a seer who ruled over the land of Zarahemla. His people included those of different cultural backgrounds; the original inhabitants of Zarahemla and Nephites who had migrated to that region under the leadership of his father. In his earlier years he personally fought in defense of his people against the Lamanites and was successful in driving them out of the land. His words are taken from private teachings to his sons (Mosiah 1:3-7), his son Mosiah II (Mosiah 1:10-14) and his final sermon to his people several years before his death in which he introduces his son Mosiah II as the new king (Mosiah 2:9-41; 3:1-2; 4:4-30; 5:6-15). Shortly before his sermon Benjamin was visited by an angel who testified of Christ and the king included the angel’s message in his words to his people (Mosiah 3:2-27). These words had a remarkable effect upon the people of his day that was remembered many years later (Helaman 5:9). <br/><br/> Benjamin spoke about the importance of avoiding contention, service to God and others, keeping the commandments, sharing one’s substance with those in need, and taking upon oneself the name of Christ. Apart from the angel, Benjamin is the only speaker in the Book of Mormon who uses the word “omnipotent” and as an attribute of God. <br/><br/> Benjamin was the custodian of the Nephite archive which consisted of the plates of brass and the plates of Nephi. These also included the small plates kept by the descendants of Jacob which were entrusted to him by Amaleki the last custodian of that record (Omni 1:25). The wording of his teachings to his royal sons suggests that in earlier years Benjamin may have drawn upon Nephi’s teachings about preserving their fathers among his children including the “language of the Egyptians” (1 Nephi 1:2; 3:19; Mosiah 1:4), that they might know and “keep the commandments” of God, and “prosper in the land” (1 Nephi 4:14-16; Mosiah 1:7), so that they and their posterity would not “dwindle in unbelief” (1 Nephi 4:13; Mosiah 1:5), that they might know the “mysteries of God” ( Nephi 1:1; Mosiah 3, 5). <br/><br/> Benjamin’s sermon was given at one of the high points of Nephite history (Mosiah 1:11). It is easy to forget that this comes after an earlier period of serious difficulty and social conflict. Both Amaleki and Mormon write that Benjamin had serious contentions and dissensions among his people early in his reign, and  It was only through prolonged and diligent effort that he and other prophets had been able to establish the peace we find at the time of his farewell address (Omni 1:24-25, 27-28; Words of Mormon 1:12-18).  Benjamin is concerned about future contention inspired by the evil one (Mosiah 2:32-33; 4:14). His teachings may provide a window into the cause of these earlier conflicts and also provide counsel to help his people and us preempt similar difficulties in the future. <br/><br/> Mormon indicates that the problem of “false Christs” (Words of Mormon 1:15-16) was associated with contention and dissensions earlier in Benjamin’s reign. In the Bible the Greek word “Christ” which is applied to Jesus in the New Testament is the equivalent of a Hebrew word meaning “anointed” and was frequently used of Israelite kings (Psalms 2.2). If “false Christs” had reference to those who were seeking to introduce false ideas about kingship among the people of Nephi or to replace Benjamin as the rightful king, then his focus upon the true nature of kingship in his final sermon can be seen as a way to correct false ideas which had contributed to the conflicts of the past. For Benjamin a proper king or ruler is one who does not seek for riches or worldly power, but who diligently serves his people and who acknowledges, obeys, relies upon, and emulates God, our heavenly king. He emphasizes that he, as a king, is not any better than his fellows and is just as dependent upon God as others should be (Mosiah 2:12-19). This view of kingship may be a response to those who might foment contention in a quest for power. <br/><br/> His concern for the poor and needy is also a significant part of his teachings. In order to retain a remission of one’s sins from day to day, one must seek to provide physical and spiritual relief to those in need (Mosiah 4:11-12). Only those who serve God as their Master can really know him (Mosiah 5:13). <br/><br/> Benjamin is the only Book of Mormon speaker to use the words beggar, beggars, begged, supporting, and dependent. He also is the only one to use the words “borroweth” “lending” and “indebted.” It is the poor and needy who most often must borrow from others. Benjamin, however, places the rich and the poor on equal footing by noting that all, even kings, are beggars and borrow from God and that all are required to lend obedience to the Lord, walk in humility, daily prayer and give according to their means. He also corrects the erroneous view that one should only help those who deserve it, noting that before God, all are unprofitable servants who receive divine mercy and blessings (Mosiah 4:17-26). <br/><br/>Even the act of bestowing upon his people a new name as children of Christ (Mosiah 5:7-12) reinforces Benjamin’s egalitarian teaching, an act which leads people of different cultures and backgrounds (the people of Zarahemla and the Nephites like people today), to see each other as one people before God. <br/><br/> Other words used exclusively by Benjamin include “render” (3), “attention” “adulterous” (1), “attempting” (1), “injure” (1), “interest” (1), “list” (1), “lively” (1), “peaceably” (1), “prize” (1), “proclaim” (1), “pronounced” (1), “quarrel” (1), “require” (1), “requires” (1), “secondly” (1), “stopped” (1), “trifle” (1), “who ever” (1), “worthless” (1).</p>

      <p>Moroni was Chief Captain over the Nephite armies.  He assumed this responsibility at the age of 25 and served for 17 years (Alma 43:3-4; 62:43, 52).  He died the year after he retired (Alma 63:3).  Moroni lived through a tumultuous time in Nephite history.  The Reign of the Judges began when he was 7.  When he was 12 he would have witnessed the devastating war between the Nephites and the Amlicites and Lamanites in which tens of thousands of his people were slain, including many women and children (Alma 2:19; 3:1-2; 4:1-3).  At the age of 22 he would have witnessed and likely participated in the devastating war against the Lamanites following the arrival of Lamanite converts in the land of Jershon.  The text indicates that this battle was the most tremendous that had ever occurred among the people of Lehi up until that time, resulting again in the death of “many thousands” (Alma 28:1-6).  It is important to consider how these events may have shaped Moroni’s early life and strategic thinking.  When we consider Moroni taking command of the Nephite armies at a young age just three years later.<br/><br/>During his time as Chief Commander he promoted a series of innovations in defensive armor (Alma 43:18-21; 44:9), fortifications (Alma 48:8; 49:1-25; 50:1-6), and forced relocation and settlement (Alma 50:7-18), designed to reduce casualties.  He also pursued a relatively liberal policy toward defeated enemy combatants (Alma 44:19-20; 62:16-17) and prisoners compared to his enemies (Compare his actions in Alma 52:38-40; 53:1-5) with those of Ammaron (Alma 56:12).  One can see these significant innovations being motivated by a desire to protect his people from the devastation they had seen in earlier conflicts.  One also wonders if his ascendancy to chief captain at a young age may have been attributed, not only to his own abilities, but also due to the great losses of men and leadership in earlier conflicts.<br/><br/>The text also shows him to be a man of God, as well as a great military leader (Alma 48:11-18).  He knew and cite scripture (Alma 46:24-26; 60:23).  He was faithful to the covenants (Alma 44:4, 11; 46:12-23) and he was willing to seek and follow the counsel of prophets like Alma (Alma 43:23-24), and defend them (Alma 46:1-3, 11).  He suffered at least one serious wound (Alma 52:35) and there are references to his suffering with his men, “all manner of afflictions of every kind” and “exceeding great sufferings,” including “hunger, thirst, and fatigue” (Alma 60:3).  He was a much loved, successful and effective leader, but it is possible that physical and psychological demands of his service may have taken their toll, leading to his death the year after his retirement at the relatively early age of 43.<br/><br/>As might be expected Moroni’s language includes words and phrases which echo his violent occupation.  He speaks of “the wounded and bleeding” (Alma 60:22), speaks graphically of those who have “bled out their lives” (Alma 60:9), and threatens the incalcitrant Zoramite rebel that he would, “spill your blood upon the ground” (Alma 44:11).  He warns the ignoble Ammaron of God’s vengeance, telling of, “the <em>sword</em> of his almighty wrath which doth hang over you” (Alma 54:6).  Moroni’s use of the word “religion” is statistically significant.  Out of the 10 references to “religion” in the Book of Mormon, 7 come from the Nephite captain.  Though not unique to him, the word freedom is also significant (8 out of 21 times come from him).  He is 33. 7 times more likely to use the word.  Out of the 21 times the word freedom occurs among Book of Mormon speaker, 7 are attributed to Moroni, meaning he is 20. 3 times more likely to use the word.<br/><br/>Only Moroni uses the name, “all powerful God” of Deity, and he does so specifically in the context of emphasizing how God had blessed his army to be victorious over a superior foe (Alma 44:5).<br/><br/>Other words and phrases unique to Moroni include, “be up and doing” (Alma 60:24), “inward,” “neglected,” “slothfulness,” “thoughtless,” “adhere,” “awaits,” “bestir,” “binds,” “bleeding,” “conflict,” “decayed,” “hearkening,” “impede,” “insurrections,” “manage,” “operate,” “prisoner,” “proposed,” “redoubled,” “spark,” “spill,” “stated,” “stupor,” “succored,” “traitors. ”Moroni quotes from a prophecy from the Patriarch Jacob, not found in the Bible which he applies to his people and their enemies in a covenant ceremony (Alma 46:24-26).  He also makes an interesting reference to the practice, under the Law of Moses, of the cleansing of vessels (Leviticus 11:32-33; Numbers 19:14-15), indicating that this was a practice known and kept by the Nephites under that law (Alma 60:23).(1)<br/><br/>There are indications, based on Moroni’s words, that he was influenced by some of the teachings of Alma who was the prophet and high priest over the Church for much of his life.  Moroni asks neglectful government leaders, “have ye forgotten the captivity of our fathers?” (Alma 60:20).  It was Alma who emphasized this teaching when warned to do so by the angel (Mosiah 27:16), and Alma obediently taught this privately (“I have always remembered the captivity of my fathers” Alma 29:12; also 36:2, 28-29) and publicly, (“Have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your fathers?” Alma 5:6).  This appears to have been an important teaching of Alma which Moroni took to heart.  Another interesting phrase is Moroni’s, “<em>my beloved brethren</em>--for <em>ye ought to be beloved</em>” (Alma 60:10).  Only Alma uses this phrase (“<em>my beloved brethren</em>, for ye are my brethren, and <em>ye ought to be beloved</em>” Alma 9:30).  Moroni’s teaching that the righteous who are killed are not lost, but enter into God’s rest, though expressed in different words, may also be based in his understanding of Alma’s teaching (Alma 14:11; Alma 60:12-13).<br/><br/><br/>1. “Why Did Moroni Refer to Vessel Impurity in Condemning the Central Government?” KnoWhy 169 (August 19, 2016). </p>

      <p>Giddianhi is a leader of the Gadianton Robbers.  Under his leadership, the Gadiantons wage war against the people of Nephi (3 Nephi 2:11).  Giddianhi sends a letter to the Nephite Chief Judge, Lachoneus I, insisting that he and the Nephites surrender their rights and territory to the Robbers (3 Nephi 3:1-10).  Lachoneus refuses and the Nephites defend themselves (3 Nephi 4:13-26).  Consequently, Giddianhi’s people are unable to plunder Nephite resources and are forced to battle the Nephites (3 Nephi 4:2-4). The Nephites defeat the Gadiantons and kill Giddianhi (3 Nephi 4:14). <br/><br/> In only 499 words, Giddianhi uses the verb “do” over seven times more frequently than speakers in the rest of the Book of Mormon.  He is the only speaker to use the word “sealing”. He uses this word in the context of writing and sealing a letter personally. <br/><br/> Giddianhi uses flattery to persuade the Nephites to surrender to his demands.  Giddianhi is the only robber in the Book of Mormon to use the words “brave” and “noble.”  He uses the word “noble” three times in his letters, referring to the Chief Judge as “most noble” (3 Nephi 3:2-3), and the Nephites’ “noble spirit in the field of battle” (3 Nephi 3:5). <br/><br/> He assures the Nephites that he can be trusted by invoking a supposedly sacred oath.  If the Nephites join them, “I <strong><em>swear</em></strong> unto you, if ye will do this, <strong><em>with an oath</em></strong>, ye shall not be destroyed.”  Otherwise, “I <strong><em>swear</em></strong> unto you <strong><em>with an oath</em></strong>, that <strong><em>on the morrow month</em></strong>” he will attack and destroy them.  Mormon’s account subtly undermines the reliability of the Giddianhi’s oath when he mentions that the Gadiantons <strong><em>did not</em></strong> attack on “the morrow month” of the sixteenth year, as promised, but about three years later (3 Nephi 4:1, 5).  <br/><br/> Giddianhi’s letter conceals his ulterior motives under a façade of concern.  He praises the Nephites’ “firmness” in battle saying, “ye do stand well, as if ye were supported by the hand of a god” (3 Nephi 3:2). At the same time, he feigns concern by “feeling” for their welfare (3 Nephi 3:5) but insists that the Nephite cause is hopeless, and that the Nephites are denying the superior skills of the Gadianton forces. <br/><br/> Giddianhi invites the Nephites the chance to join him in familial terms (3 Nephi 3:7). They can be “brethren.” Giddianhi “was exceedingly expert in many words” to seduce the unwary, and thereby gain influence, power, and destruction to others (Helaman 2:4). <br/><br/> Symbolic of the devil, Giddianhi’s clever and flattering words are a deceptive front concealing a hungry predator of unbridled enmity.  <br/><br/></p>

      <p>Helaman was one of the sons of Alma II and became High Priest over the Church following the departure of his father. During the long war with the Lamanites Helaman led a force of 2000 sons of the Ammonite converts whose military actions were a key factor in the victory of Nephite forces in the southern quarter of the land and the recapture of Nephite possession in that sector. Helaman’s words come primarily from a lengthy letter he wrote to Captain Moroni who was the chief commander over Nephite forces during the war.<br/><br/>The main focus of Helaman’s epistle is war. This is reflected in his language. Only Helaman uses the words supply, surrendered, sallying, secrete, faction, movements, retreats, toiling, weariness, convey, opposed, ordered all words associated with the labors and strategies of armies. Helaman also uses other words and phrases which although used by some other Book of Mormon voices, expand his military vocabulary. These include references to army sizes, cities as objects of defense or attack, prisoners, march, army, and strength.<br/><br/> Helaman uses the verb deliver five times in the sense of delivering up weapons or prisoners to an opposing force or to confinement elsewhere. Another five times deliver is used in reference to God delivering Helaman and his people from their enemies.<br/><br/>Helaman’s father Alma had entrusted him with the plates of brass and reminded him of their value (Alma 37:3-20). Evidence suggests that Helaman took this counsel to heart and studied earlier military accounts such as the Book of Joshua, a version of which was presumably included in those records. The tactics used to recapture of the city of Manti are similar to those used by the Israelites in the successful campaign against the Canaanite fortress of Ai. 1) There is an assurance of victory (Joshua 8:1; Alma 58:10-11), 2) a small force pitches their tents outside the city (Joshua 8:10-11; Alma 58:13), 3) an ambush is set (Joshua 8:4, 12-13; Alma 58:18), 4) the enemy army is decoyed out of their fortifications to pursue the smaller army (Joshua 8:14-15; Alma 58:19), 5) the hidden ambush party captures the city (Joshua 8:17, 19; Alma 58:20-22). These similarities are particularly interesting since the Israelite victory over Ai follows on the heels of a disastrous defeat due to Israel’s transgression and Israel is unable to proceed with their campaign until this transgression is dealt with (Joshua 7). The victory of Helaman’s little army underscores the miraculous blessings that are available when how the Lord’s people, like Helaman’s young warriors, are faithful to a man.<br/><br/>This connection is strengthened by words and phrases in Helaman’s epistle which suggest that he was drawing upon a version of Joshua’s account to teach important lessons. The striplings’ confidence that “<em>God is with us</em>” (Alma 56:46) recalls the Lord’s promise to Joshua that “as I was with <em>Moses I will be with thee</em>: I will not fail thee nor forsake thee” (Joshua 1:5), and “the Lord thy <em>God is with thee</em>” (Joshua 1:9).<br/><br/>The Lord counseled Joshua to “be <em>strong</em> and of good <em>courage</em>” (Joshua 1:6, 9), and to “be <em>strong</em> and <em>very courageous</em>” (Joshua 1:7). Helaman stresses the courage of his little army. “Never have I seen so great courage, nay, not among all the Nephites” (Alma 56:45; 58:12).<br/><br/>Helaman notes that he and his Ammonite force “were <em>not strong</em> according to our numbers” (Alma 58:15), yet they were strong in the faith of God and their obedience to his commandments. “Their faith is <em>strong</em> in the prophecies concerning that which is to come” (Alma 58:40). Recognizing their numerical weakness, they looked to God for strength. “Therefore, we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would <em>strengthen</em> us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea and also give us <em>strength</em>” (Alma 58:10). Such strength was given them that they frightened their enemies even though they were fewer in numbers.  “They had fought as if with the <em>strength of God</em>; yea, <em>never</em> were men known to have fought with such <em>miraculous strength</em>; and with such mighty power” (Alma 56:56).<br/><br/>Helaman states that when their enemies pursued them they “durst <em>not turn to the right nor to the left</em> lest they should be surrounded; neither would I <em>turn to the right nor to the left</em> lest they should overtake me” (Alma 56:37; 40). This phrase echoes the Lord’s counsel to Joshua that he “<em>observe</em> to do” God’s law and “<em>turn not from it to the right hand or to the left</em>” (Joshua 1:7). <br/><br/>The decisive efforts of Helaman’s forces lead to a Nephite victory. Helaman says that his young army “did obey and observe to perform every word of commend with <em>exactness</em>” (Alma 57:21), but this military discipline was equaled by their moral rectitude. <em>Never deviating</em> from their obligations to God. Helaman says, “they were strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea,, they do <em>observe</em> to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually” (Alma 58:40).<br/><br/>The words “right” and “left” are used together by several other Book of Mormon speakers in reference to those on the right or left hand of God at the day of judgment (Mosiah 5:10, 12), at the day or in reference to God’s ways (Alma 7:20; 3 Nephi 29:9), and of the people of Anti-Nephi Lehi willing to standing unmovable even in the face of death (Alma 24:23),  but only Helaman uses it in connection with the movement of armies.</p>

      <p>Jacob was Lehi’s fifth son and was born during the family’s difficult wilderness journey to the land of promise. When the family separated after the death of Lehi Jacob followed his brother Nephi and was consecrated as a priest over his people. Nephi recorded some of Jacob’s prophecies on the small plates and following Nephi’s death Jacob and his descendants continued to keep the record.<br/><br/>Lehi said that Jacob’s days would be “spent in the service of thy God” (2 Nephi 2:3), and Jacob and his younger brother Joseph were consecrated by Nephi to be the first priests over the people of Nephi (2 Nephi 5:26). Notably, Jacob’s vocabulary reflects this calling as a righteous priest. <br/><br/>Jacob uses the noun “atonement” eight times, more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon (2 Nephi 9:7, 25-26; Jacob 4:11-12; 7:12). This term figures prominently in priestly texts such as Leviticus which discuss Israelite sacrificial practices. References to “fatness,” (2 Nephi 9:51), “firstfruits” (Jacob 4:11), Abraham’s offering of his son Isaac as a symbol of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son of God (Jacob 4:5), the image of garments stained with blood (2 Nephi 9:44; Jacob 1:19), all evoke the sacrifices and offerings of ancient temple worship and this background seems to provide the context for many of Jacob’s teachings<br/><br/>In ancient Israel the temple represented the presence of God and was considered holy. <br/><br/>Righteous temple worship demanded ritual purity, and deliberate preparation. Those who were not ritually pure were not allowed to enter. Jacob speaks of the righteous being “clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness” (2 Nephi 9:14), which recall the whiteness of ancient priestly clothing. He vividly contrasts uncleanliness or filthiness, sin, transgression, and guilt with holiness, purity, and righteousness. Those who are unclean or filthy are cut off from God’s presence just as the ritually unprepared are shut out from the temple (2 Nephi 9:6, 9).<br/><br/>Jacob refers to Christ’s role as Creator more than any other Book of Mormon speaker.  He uses terms such as “Maker” (2 Nephi 9:40; Jacob 2:6) “great Creator” (2 Nephi 9:5-6; Jacob 3:7), “all powerful Creator” (Jacob 2:5). <br/><br/>Jacob uses the divine title “Holy One of Israel” 17 times, more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon. Others who use the title include Nephi (10 times) Isaiah in the Book of Mormon (7 times), Amaleki (2 times), Lehi (2 times), and Zenos (2 times). Significantly, all of these are found in the words of writers on the small plates, except for 3 Nephi 22:5 where Jesus quotes Isaiah.<br/><br/>The phrase “the power of” which occurs 17 times in Jacob’s writings is primarily used in reference to God and his power manifested through his words, the atonement and resurrection, justice, the Holy Ghost. Only rarely does it refer to the power of the devil (once) or the power of Jacob’s people to defend themselves (17 vs. 3.9 for 4.5).<br/><br/>Among Book of Mormon speakers Jacob has the second highest number of exclusive words and phrases (78) with a high Z of any speaker (only Isaiah in the Book of Mormon is higher). is higher).<br/><br/>Jacob shows an ability to portray abstract concepts in vivid images. His characterization of death, hell, the devil, and endless torment as an “awful monster” is notable (2 Nephi 9:10, 19, 26). In his temple sermon condemning sin he speaks of “the piercing eye of the Almighty God” (Jacob 2:10), and reminds the rich and proud that with “one glance of his eye he can smite you” (Jacob 2:15). He fears that his words will “enlarge the wounds of those already wounded” and will be like “daggers placed to pierce the souls and wound the delicate minds” of the vulnerable (Jacob 2:9).<br/><br/>Jacob talks more about his feelings than other Book of Mormon speakers. His language often seems more personal and intimate.<br/><br/></p>
      <p>Half the [Book of Mormon] citations of “anxiety” occur in the book of Jacob, and over two thirds of the references to “grieve,” “tender,” and “shame” (or their derivatives) appear in Jacob’s writings. He is the only person to use ”delicate,” “contempt,” and “lonesome.” Likewise, only Jacob uses “wound” to refer to emotional, not physical injuries, as in the rest of the Book of Mormon. Similarly, he uses “pierce” or its variants frequently (four of the ten instances) and exclusively in a spiritual sense. Such lexical evidence suggests an author who lives close to his emotions.(1)</p>

      <p>In his parting blessing Lehi indicated that Jacob had been abused and treated harshly by his older brothers Laman and Lemuel. “And behold, in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because of the rudeness of thy brethren” (2 Nephi 2:1), yet, he had also been blessed with a remarkable testimony of Christ, “And thou hast beheld in thy youth his glory, wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh” (2 Nephi 2:4). A certain knowledge of God’s holiness and the existence of abomination and wickedness among his own people causes him, “to shrink with shame before the presence of my Maker” (Jacob 2:5). His empathy, perhaps gained through his own earlier afflictions manifests itself in a reluctance (based in his concern for the vulnerable), to preach harsh messages, even when he must. He feels “weighed down” (Jacob 2:3), it </p>

      <p>Korihor is a dissident teacher among the Nephites who teaches that there is no God and preaches against Christ. He is active during the seventeenth year of the reign of the Judges during the ministry of Alma II. He promotes a materialist outlook toward life, holding that this life is all that matters. He claims that man prospers only according to his abilities, that “whatever a man did was no crime” (Alma 30:17) and that “when a man was dead, that was the end thereof” (Alma 30:18). According to Korihor, there is no such thing as sin, thus there is no need for an atonement. Actions and ordinances based upon the idea of Christ are foolishness. Joy from repentance, and spiritual gifts such as personal revelation are a fantasy based upon a deranged mind (Alma 30:13-16).<br/>&gt;br&gt;Korihor’s teachings lead many of the Nephites to commit serious sin (Alma 30:18), but because he claims to teach what he believes, he cannot be punished according to the law. (Alma 30:7-12). Eventually, Korihor is brought before Nephihah, the Chief Judge and Alma the High Priest who questions Korihor, refuting his accusations of priestcraft (Alma 30:32-34). Alma bears testimony of God (Alma 30:39-42). When Korihor asks for a sign of the power of God, God smites Korihor dumb. In writing, Korihor confesses that the devil appeared to him in the form of an angel, told him what to say, and deceived him (Alma30:51-53). Korihor lives the rest of his life begging the Zoramites for food. He is cast out and trampled to death (Alma 30:59).<br/><br/>Korihor is the only Book of Mormon speaker to use the words “whims,” “derangement,” “frenzied,” “foolish,” “foolish traditions,” “ordinances and performances,” “unknown being,” and “pretended mysteries.” His application of the word “pretended” to Nephite spiritual gifts is noteworthy.<br/><br/>These words reinforce his false materialist message which asserts that one can only know what one can experience with the natural senses. In Korihor’s view, God is an “unknown being” because people cannot see him. Nephite mysteries are “pretended” for the same reason.<br/><br/><br/>Korihor is a skilled messenger of an evil message. Korihor’s words reveal the tactics of the devil, who taught him what to say. His words display shame tactics to try make those who belief and obey Gospel ordinances appear or feel silly. In Alma 30, Korihor uses the unique phrase, “the foolish traditions of your fathers” three times, suggesting that shame is a common element of his message.<br/><br/>Korihor appeals to the carnal nature of his listeners by making obedience to divine commandments seem difficult. His words turn Nephite teachings about redemption from the bondage of sin and the liberty of the Gospel on its head by characterizing the belief in Christ, and the need to prepare for life after this as a form of bondage that keeps individuals from doing what they want. This teaching appeals to the natural man.<br/><br/>Freedom, according to Korihor, is living without the constraints while you can and before you die. “Ye say that this people is a free people. Behold, I say they are in bondage” (Alma 30:24). Other words and phrases underscore this theme such as “bound down,” “bind themselves down,” “brought down,” “yoke,” and “bondage.” Nephite religious leaders want to “keep them down” in a state of subservience.<br/><br/>Korihor hides his own base motivations by falsely accusing those who teach the Gospel of seeking power and other worldly interests. Human nature tends to rebel against feelings of unfairness and inequity. Korihor appeals to his listeners by claiming religious authorities want to “glut” themselves on labors and fruits of others based on things that cannot be seen or experienced by those they exploit.<br/><br/>Another example of deception is presenting partial truths. He does this when he disparages the doctrine of the fall of man. “Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a parent. Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents” (Alma 30:25). Who wants to be unfair to children? Nephite doctrine teaches that Christ atoned for Adams transgression, and that little children have eternal life through the Redeemer. Nephite doctrine also teaches that individuals are responsible for their own sins and transgression, but Korihor’s incomplete characterization taints the doctrine with an appearance of unfairness.<br/><br/>Korihor’s clever, but empty words, are inspired by the devil. His messages are designed to shame others faithful followers of Christ and lead them lead away from Christ.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

      <p>The prophet Lehi was a contemporary of Jeremiah and called to preach repentance to the people of Jerusalem during the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, King of Judah (597 B.C.). After his message was rejected his life was in danger and the Lord commanded him to flee from his homeland. He led his family through a wilderness journey to a new land of promise in the Americas. Some of his revelations and teachings were recorded in the record of his son Nephi in the Book of Mormon. These include his divine call, his vision of the tree of life, teachings about the coming of the Messiah, and prophecies about his children and their descendants. His family was greatly blessed by God, but often experienced conflict stemming from the rebellions of his oldest sons who were jealous of their brother Nephi, did not believe his prophetic teachings or those of their father. <br/><br/> In addition to the fruit and the tree of life which he saw in his vision, Lehi’s words also focus on his own fruit—his seed, his sons and children are favored topics. He is interested in blessings and his teachings and prophecies center around the covenants God made with the house of Israel and with him. <br/><br/> Only Lehi uses the words “acted” (3), “dreamed” (2), “dreary” (2), “last-born” (2), “beckoned” (1), “captivate” (1), “childhood” (1), “clinging” (1), “cold” and “traveler” (1), “commanding” (1), “dress” (1), “dying” (1), “enticed” (1), “incur” (1), “inflicting” (1), “innocence” (1), “mocking” (1), “scoffing” (1), “vanished” (1), “visitations” (1). <br/><br/> Lehi is the first Book of Mormon prophet to teach about the “Messiah.” This term is also used by other early Nephite writers such as Nephi, Jacob, and Jarom, but is only found twice outside the small plates. Only Lehi uses the words “Holy Messiah.” Notably, the words “Christ” or “Jesus Christ” are not found in Lehi’s writings.<br/><br/> Throughout his life Lehi experienced the hard blows of life. The demands of his calling required that he abandoned his ancestral lands of inheritance and abandon most of his possessions. Years of danger, affliction, hunger (1 Nephi 16:19-32), and the death of friends (1 Nephi 16:34-35). The frequent rebellions of Laman, Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael took their toll and on at least one occasion nearly overwhelmed him (1 Nephi 18:17-18). Lehi is the only speaker in the Book of Mormon to use the words “opposition” (4). He also recognized the blessings his family had received and how merciful the Lord had been (2 Nephi 1:1:2). Looking back on his life he could say, “the Lord hath redeemed my soul from hell; I have beheld his glory, and I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love” (2 Nephi 1:15). <br/><br/> Lehi is also the only Book of Mormon prophet to use the term “Mediator” (2). One wonders if this may reflect his family situation in his later life which included so much strife between his children. Such conflict would have required him as a father and leader to mediate, sometimes unsuccessfully, between rival interests. In light of this it may be significant that he taught his children shortly before his death to look toward their Divine Redeemer, “the great Mediator of all men” (2 Nephi 2:27-28). <br/><br/></p>

      <p>Mormon was the chief commander over the armies of the Nephites during their last decades as a people (Mormon 1-6) and the keeper of the sacred history of his people during that time. He was a disciple of Jesus Christ (3 Nephi 5:12-13) and a great prophet.  During his final years he compiled an abridgment of the records in his custody on plates named after him which he entrusted to his son Moroni.<br/><br/>Given his role as the primary historian of the Book of Mormon it is not surprising that Mormon’s most favorite word relating to time is the word “year” (262).  Exclusive to Mormon is the phrase “year of the reign of the judges over the people” (46 times) and word “fifth” (27 times).  It is also not surprising that he focuses on those about whom he is writing such as “the Lamanites” (519) “people” (244) “the people” (386) “the people of” (264) “of Nephi” (208), “the Nephites” (311). <br/><br/>The majority of geographical references in the Book of Mormon come from Mormon. Words and phrases relating to locations include “city” (191), “the land” (171), “the land of” (259), “of the land” (164), “in the land” (147).  Most words and phrases dealing with geography are from Mormon.  Book of Mormon geography is essentially Mormon’s Map.<br/><br/>Mormon’s most favorite words of named and unnamed individuals include Alma (244), Moroni (182), Ammon (160), “king” (136), or “the king” (214).  Most numerous among individuals mentioned are words for deity, “the Lord” (312), “God” (200), “of God” (237), “Christ” (140), which combined together constitute a substantial number (689). <br/><br/>Mormon uses the adjective “great” 274 times in the Book of Mormon.  Notably, the most common object of this word is joy as in “great joy” (17 times), followed by “power” (12), “destruction” (10), and “things” (10).<br/><br/>Mormon lived through the last years of his people and witnessed their horrible decline into wickedness and depravity.  His life was, consequently, filled with much sorrow.  In light of this, having seen so much in his life that was evil and discouraging, it is significant that in his writings he focused upon the great joy that was available through the living Christ and his eternal Gospel.  Reasons for such joy are grounded in the mercies and blessings the Lord bestowed upon his people as recorded in the Book of Mormon. </p>

      <p>Mormon the chief abridger of the Nephite record known as the Book of Mormon provides an account of the teachings of Jesus in 3 Nephi. He indicates that he included only a small part of the Savior’s teachings available to him (3 Nephi 26:8). Notably, both he and his son Moroni occasionally reference or provide quotations from the resurrected Jesus to the Nephites that are not found in the selection in 3 Nephi. An examination of these passages provides further insights into the writing of both prophets.<br/><br/><em>Jesus’ exposition of the Scriptures</em>:<br/>And now it came to pass that when <strong><em>Jesus had expounded all the scriptures in one, which they had written</em></strong>, he commanded them that they should <strong><em>teach the things which he had expounded unto them</em></strong> (3 Nephi 23:14).<br/><br/>In another passage Mormon writes:<br/>And now it came to pass that when Jesus had told these things <strong><em>he expounded them unto the multitude; and he did expound all things unto them, both great and small</em></strong>. And he saith: These scriptures, which ye had not with you, the Father commanded that I should give unto you; for it was wisdom in him that they should be given unto future generations. <strong><em>And he did expound all things, even from the beginning until the time that he should come in his glory</em></strong>—yea, even all things which should come upon the face of the earth, even until the elements should melt with fervent heat, and the earth should be wrapt together as a scroll, and the heavens and the earth should pass away; And even unto the great and last day, when all people, and all kindreds, and all nations and tongues shall stand before God, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil—If they be good, to the resurrection of everlasting life; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of damnation; being on a parallel, the one on the one hand and the other on the other hand, according to the mercy, and the justice, and the holiness which is in Christ, who was before the world began (3 Nephi 26:1-5).<br/><br/>Mormon mentions that Jesus provided a detailed exposition and teachings about these things but does not quote or provide details about what Jesus actually said. He just gives a very general outline of the subject matter. He then explains:<br/><br/>And now <strong><em>there cannot be written in this book even a hundredth part of the things which Jesus did truly teach unto the people</em></strong>; But behold the plates of Nephi do contain the more part of the things which he taught the people. And <strong><em>these things</em></strong> have I written, which are a <strong><em>lesser part of the things which he taught the people</em></strong>; and I have written them to the intent that they may be brought again unto this people, from the Gentiles, according to the words which Jesus hath spoken. And when they shall have received <strong><em>this</em></strong>, which is expedient that they should have first, to try their faith, and if it shall so be that they shall believe these things then shall the <strong><em>greater things</em></strong> be made manifest unto them. And if it so be that they will not believe these things, then shall the <strong><em>greater things</em></strong> be withheld from them, unto their condemnation. Behold, <strong><em>I was about to write them, all which were engraven upon the plates of Nephi, but the Lord forbade it</em></strong>, saying: I will try the faith of my people. Therefore, <strong><em>I, Mormon, do write the things which have been commanded me</em></strong> of the Lord (3 Nephi 26:6-12).<br/><br/>So, when Mormon was recording the words of Jesus in his abridgment of the Nephite records for 3 Nephi he was commanded by the Lord to only include a small part of the teachings of Jesus that he had. When he discusses the future ministry of the three Nephite disciples he does not go into detail, but mentions that there are other teachings of Jesus that discuss what they will do.<br/><br/>And behold they will be among the Gentiles, and the Gentiles shall know them not. They will also be among the Jews, and the Jews shall know them not. And it shall come to pass, when the Lord seeth fit in his wisdom that they shall minister unto all the scattered tribes of Israel, and unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, and shall bring out of them unto Jesus many souls, that their desire may be fulfilled, and also because of the convincing power of God which is in them. And they are as the angels of God, and if they shall pray unto the Father in the name of Jesus they can show themselves unto whatsoever man it seemeth them good. Therefore, great and marvelous works shall be wrought by them, before the great and coming day when all people must surely stand before the judgment-seat of Christ; Yea even among the Gentiles shall there be a great and marvelous work wrought by them, before that judgment day. <strong><em>And if ye had all the scriptures which give an account of all the marvelous works of Christ, ye would, according to the words of Christ, know that these things must surely come</em></strong>. (3 Nephi 28:27-33).<br/><br/>Here Mormon alludes to other words of Christ which provide details on these things, but he obediently references them only in general terms. <br/><br/><em>3 Nephi 29:7</em><br/>In another passage Mormon writes<br/>Yea, and wo unto him that shall say at that day, to get gain, that there can be no miracle wrought by Jesus Christ; for he that doeth this shall become like unto the son of perdition, for whom there was no mercy, <strong><em>according to the word of Christ!</em></strong> (3 Nephi 29:7).<br/><br/>We do not have the words of Christ which speak about the son of perdition no receiving mercy, but apparently the Nephites had a record of these words and Mormon references, but does not quote them.<br/><br/><em>4 Nephi 1:31</em><br/>In 4 Nephi Mormon described the persecution suffered by the three disciples of Jesus.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, and notwithstanding all these miracles, the people did harden their hearts, and did seek to kill them, even as the Jews at Jerusalem sought to kill Jesus, <strong><em>according to his word</em></strong> (4 Nephi 1:31).<br/><br/>We have no record in our current Book of Mormon of Jesus describing the efforts of the Jews to kill him during his mortal ministry, but apparently the Nephites did, but Mormon does not quote them. Mormon quotes the words of Jesus in his commentary on Nephite apostasy in the book of Helaman before he gets to 3 Nephi.<br/><br/><em>Helaman 12:26</em><br/><br/>Yea, who shall be consigned to a state of endless misery, <strong><em>fulfilling the words which say</em></strong>: They that have done good shall have everlasting life, and they that have done evil shall have everlasting damnation. And thus it is. Amen (Helaman 12:26).<br/><br/>These words, which are similar to words found in the Gospel of John 5:29 are not found in the teachings of Jesus in 3 Nephi. Assuming these were words given by the resurrected Jesus to the Nephites, this would be the only example where Mormon actually quotes words from Jesus’ resurrected ministry to the Nephites and not found in that account. Usually, he only references a teaching of Jesus in passing without actually providing a quotation.<br/><br/>After his father’s death, Moroni includes a sermon from his father on the plates. This document had not been included in Mormon’s abridgment, but includes several quotations from the Savior’s resurrected ministry to the Nephites not found elsewhere in the Book of Mormon.<br/><br/><em>Moroni 7:26, 33-34</em><br/>And after that he came men also were saved by faith in his name; and by faith, they become the sons of God. And as surely as Christ liveth <strong><em>he spake these words unto our fathers</em></strong>, saying: Whatsoever thing ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is good, in faith believing that ye shall receive, behold, it shall be done unto you (Moroni 7:26).<br/><br/><strong><em>And Christ hath said</em></strong>: If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me (Moroni 7:33).<br/><br/><strong><em>And he hath said</em></strong>: Repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, and have faith in me, that ye may be saved (Moroni 7:34).<br/><br/>The last passage is similar to but not the same as that in 3 Nephi 27:20 which does not include the words “and have faith in me, that ye may be saved” suggesting that this was from another source. Significantly these additional quotations do not come from Mormon’s abridgment but fortuitously from Moroni’s inclusion of his father’s sermon.<br/><br/>Moroni, who took charge of the Nephite record after the death of his father also provide additional words from Jesus’ teachings to the Nephites in his own writings. One of the longest examples is as follows.<em>Mormon 9:22-25</em><br/>For behold, <strong><em>thus said Jesus Christ, the Son of God, unto his disciples who should tarry, yea, and also to all his disciples, in the hearing of the multitude</em></strong>: Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature; And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned; And these signs shall follow them that believe—in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover; And whosoever shall believe in my name, doubting nothing, unto him will I confirm all my words, even unto the ends of the earth (Mormon 9:22-25).<br/><br/>This passage partially resembles words found in Mark 16:15-18, a passage which some biblical scholars have argued was not original to the text of Mark. What is interesting here is that Mormon solemnly affirms that Jesus spoke these words to the three Nephite disciples, the Nephite Twelve, and that the multitude heard it also. There were numerous witnesses that he gave these teachings to the Nephites. This is an example in which the Book of Mormon supports the teachings of Jesus found in the Bible and suggests that whatever the textual history of Mark that these were authentic teachings from the Savior which somehow were lost from earlier biblical manuscripts or were given orally by the Savior and not recorded, but which are true.<br/><br/><em>Passages in the Book of Ether</em><br/>Moroni draws upon teachings of the resurrected Jesus in his abridgment of the book of Ether.<br/>And the Lord commanded the brother of Jared to go down out of the mount from the presence of the Lord and write the things which he had seen; and they were forbidden to come unto the children of men until after that he should be lifted up upon the cross; and for this cause did king Mosiah keep them, that they should not come unto the world until after Christ should show himself unto his people. <strong><em>And after Christ truly had showed himself unto his people, he commanded that they should be made manifest</em></strong> (Ether 4:2).<br/><br/>We do not have the account Moroni’s speaks of in 3 Nephi, but it was included in the teachings of Jesus to the Nephites which Moroni knows about.<br/><br/>And <strong><em>I also remember that thou hast said</em></strong> that thou hast <strong><em>prepared a house for man, yea, even among the mansions of thy Father</em></strong>, in which man might have a more excellent hope; wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared (Ether 12:32).<br/><br/>This passage is interesting because it reminds us of John 14:2 although it reads differently and includes additional teachings. This suggests that Moroni is citing a passage from some of the teachings not included by Mormon in 3 Nephi.<br/><br/>Wherefore, I know by this thing which thou hast said, that if the Gentiles have not charity, because of our weakness, that thou wilt prove them, and <strong><em>take away their talent, yea, even that which they have received, and give unto them who shall have more abundantly</em></strong> (Ether 12:33).<br/><br/>This passage again reminds us of similar teachings from Jesus in the New Testament in the parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14-30). This suggests that the Nephites may have possessed a similar parable (or its equivalent in Nephite terms since “talent” was a word peculiar to the Roman World) which Moroni drew upon in his commentary and applies to the Gentiles.And again, <strong><em>I remember that thou hast said</em></strong> that thou hast loved the world, even unto the laying down of thy life for the world, that thou mightest take it again to prepare a place for the children of men (Ether 12:35).<br/><br/>While the concept is found in other Book of Mormon passages, the difference in phrasing indicates that Moroni drew upon additional words of Jesus.<br/><br/><em>Moroni 10:23</em><br/>In his final words to the reader of the Book of Mormon Moroni draws upon the words of Jesus known to him.<br/><br/>And <strong><em>Christ truly said unto our fathers</em></strong>: If ye have faith ye can do all things which are expedient unto me (Ether 10:23).<br/><br/>This statement attributed to Jesus is similar to Mormon’s quotation in Moroni 7:33 but not exactly the same suggesting that it may have been from a different source, or perhaps the statement in Moroni 7:33 and 10:23 represent these prophet’s paraphrases of Jesus’ words rather than an exact record.<br/><br/><strong>Key Findings</strong><br/><br/>Mormon tells readers of the Book of Mormon that he only gave us a small part of the teachings of Jesus to the Nephites available to him. His reference to additional teachings supports this, and general references to some of these teachings without quoting them shows that Mormon was consistent and obedient to the commandment he received from the Lord to only provide a small part of those teachings in his abridged text.<br/><br/>Most of the non-3 Nephi quotations are found due to Moroni’s work. He includes a sermon from his father about which we would otherwise know nothing that includes three separate quotations from the Savior’s additional teachings. His paraphrases in the Book of Mormon also point to additional teachings and suggest that at least one parable may have been part of the larger corpus of material from the resurrected Savior. This increases our appreciation for Moroni’s additional inclusions of these precious words from the Savior.<br/><br/>Moroni’s citation of a Mark-like passage provides additional testimony to the Book of Mormon reader that these teachings are genuine although manuscript evidence for similar teachings in biblical manuscripts for Mark is weak and constitutes one example of how the Book of Mormon and the Bible work together to increase faith in the words of Jesus found in both books of Scripture</p>

      <p>Moroni was the son of Mormon and the last Nephite record keeper in the Book of Mormon. He was a missionary (Moroni 8:.1-2). During the battle at Cumorah he led a cohort of 10,000 and he was one of only twenty-four Nephite survivors from the battle (Mormon 6:11-12).  After the death of his father Mormon, Moroni wandered for more than thirty-five years until he was able to finish, seal up, and bury the plates in the hill in New York.<br/><br/>Moroni’s words include biographical and prophetic material written after his father’s death (Mormon 8-9), his abridgement and commentary on the record of Ether (Ether 1-15), instructions on Church government (Moroni 1-6), and his farewell words to future readers (Moroni 10).  He visited Joseph Smith, Jr. as a resurrected personage in 1823 to reveal to Joseph Smith the location of the plates and between 1823-and 1830 continued to teach and prepare himself to translate and publish the book and appeared to the three witnesses of the Book of Mormon (The Testimony of Three Witnesses).  Latter-day revelation indicates that he continues to have a role in the Lord’s work under his direction in the Latter-days (D&amp;C 133:36).<br/><br/>Moroni is the only writer/speaker among the top eight in the Book of Mormon whose use of the words Christ and faith are both in his top 50 contextual words and are also statistically significant.

Other words which only occur in the abridgement of Ether’s record include 26 proper names not mentioned anywhere else in the Book of Mormon, “dwelt in captivity” (7), “tight like unto a dish” (5), and “slept” (4).<br/><br/>Moroni’s words include some of his own revelations from God, but one of his significant characteristics as a writer is his tendency to pepper his words with those of earlier writers. As one scholar observes, “his first inclination is to use the words of his predecessors” and he does so “by interweaving distinctive phrases and structural schemes from multiple thematically related sources.”(1)<br/><br/>Moroni’s words show significant influence from the small plates of Nephi, as he sometimes quotes from or paraphrases from that record.  Such phrases include, “the blood of the Saints shall cry” (Mormon 8:27; 2 Nephi 26:22; 28:9-10), and his reference to a scripture which says God, “is the same yesterday, today, and forever” (Mormon 9:9; Moroni 10:19; 1 Nephi 10:18).  His description of the final judgement also seems to draw upon the language of Jacob when he uses the phrases, “And then cometh the judgement,” that the “filthy shall be filthy still,” and that the “righteous shall be righteous still” (Mormon 9:14; 2 Nephi 9:15-16).  Moroni, however, adds the meaningful words, “he that is happy shall be happy still; and he that is unhappy shall be unhappy still” (Mormon 9:14).  Moroni’s critique of those who ignore the poor and needy may have been influenced by Nephi’s teaching.  Both speaks of “pride,” neglect of the “poor,” a materialist focus on “fine” things, including clothing and church adornment, which infect all “save or few” (Moroni 8:36-37; “save it be a few” 2 Nephi 28:11-14).  His reference to those who justify sin (Mormon 8:31) may also echo Nephi’s words on the same theme.<br/><br/>Moroni writes that the time may come that “Satan may have no power upon the hearts of the children of men” (Ether 8:26), which nearly matches Nephi’s prophecy, “Satan shall have power over the hearts of the children of men no more for a long time” (2 Nephi 30:18; 1 Nephi 22:15, 26).  And a scripture which says the first shall be last and the last shall be first (Ether 13:12; 1 Nephi 13:42; Jacob 5:63.<br/><br/>In his final farewell Moroni says his words help to fulfill earlier prophecies that they shall “proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lord” and that “his word shall hiss forth” (Moroni 10:28).  The prophecy seems to be the Lord’s words spoken to Nephi that “the words of your seed should proceed out of my mouth unto your seed; and my words shall hiss forth unto the ends of the earth” (2 Nephi 29:2; 25:21-22).  It is especially interesting that Moroni evokes words and images from Jacob and Nephi’s farewell when he speaks of meeting readers at the “bar” of God “as one speaking out of the dust” (Moroni 10:27-28; “as one crying from the dust” (2 Nephi 33:11, 13).  Like Jacob Nephi wants to “meet you before the pleasing bar” of God (Moroni 10:34; Jacob 6:13).<br/><br/>He is familiar with Isaiah (Mormon 8:23; Moroni 10:31) and includes teachings from his father, including a sermon on faith, hope, and charity (Moroni 7), a letter condemning the baptism of little children by members of the Church of Christ (Moroni 8), and describing the wickedness of the Nephites in their final days (Moroni 9).  It is clear that his father’s teachings had a tremendous influence on him.<br/><br/>In addition to the small plates, which were included with the abridgment (Words of Mormon 1:1-8), Moroni also knows of and cites teachings of the resurrected Jesus which were not included in the account in 3 Nephi (Mormon 9:22-25; Ether 12:32-33, 35; 10:23), some of which he may have learned from the three disciples who tarried who had ministered to him and his father (Mormon 8:10-11)).  Moroni makes use of a diversity of sources.<br/><br/> </p>

      <p>Mosiah was the son of King Benjamin and the last Nephite king in the land of Zarahemla.  He became king at the age of 30 (Mosiah 6:4).  He presided over the deliverance and reunification of Limhi’s people and the people of Alma with his own (Mosiah 7:1-2; 22:13-14; 24:25).  He also supported the establishment of the Church, under Alma’s leadership, throughout the land (Mosiah 25:19; 26:8-12).  Persecution of the Church by unbelievers became a serious issue during his reign and he established laws to forbid persecution on the basis of religious beliefs and promote equity among his people (Mosiah 27:1-5).  His four sons with Alma, the son of Alma the High Priest, were once numbered among the unbelievers who persecuted the Church were converted through the miraculous intervention of an angel (Mosiah 27:8-37).  While this event was a cause for rejoicing, it created a political challenge when his sons refused the kingship and devoted their lives to preaching the Gospel among the Lamanites (Mosiah 28:1-10).  Under Divine direction and with the voice of the people, he discontinued the institution of kingship among the Nephites and established the reign of judges (Mosiah 29:1-11).  In addition to being a king, Mosiah was also responsible for the establishment of a set of laws to govern the new political system, including a law forbidding slavery (Alma 1:1; 27:9), as well as a money standard (Alma 11:1).  Mosiah also possessed the gift of seership which he used to translate the 24 gold plates discovered by Limhi’s people which gave an account of the Jaredites (Mosiah 28:11-19).  It is notable that in spite of the increasing social complexity within his kingdom, there is no reference to war among the people of Zarahemla during the 23 years of his reign (Mosiah 29:14).  Given the history of the people of Lehi, this seems a remarkable achievement.<br/><br/>The word “higher” occurs only four times in the Book of Mormon.  Three of these are from Mosiah.  Words about judgement are 38 times more likely to be spoken by Mosiah than in the rest of the Book of Mormon.  Words about laws are nearly 15 times more likely to be spoken by Mosiah than in the rest of the text.  The “unrighteous” appears only 3 times in the Book of Mormon.  One of these three times it is used by Mosiah.  It is 10 times more likely that the words iniquity, iniquities, or iniquitous are used, and 50 times more likely that the words pervert or perverting are used by Mosiah than by the other speaker in the rest of the Nephite record.  This is understandable for a king whose like is occupied with the trappings of government and the judgement of crime and punishment (Mosiah 29:15).<br/><br/> Mosiah is the only Book of Mormon speaker to refer to God as the “all-wise” Creator.  He also is the only one to use the words “arrange,” “enacteth,” “extending,” “iniquitous,” “interposition,” “newly,” “posterity,” “remains,” “sees,” and “trampleth. ”<br/><br/>Mosiah’s words, although they are few, suggest that he drew upon several sources.  His concerns over the danger that his son Aaron might change his mind, desire the kingship, and “draw away” a faction of the people, leading to contention and bloodshed points to influence from the Jaredite record he has translated which recounts the actions of sons of kings who “drew away” or did “draw away” such factions (Ether 7:4, 15; 9:11; 10:32).  Only the book of Ether shares this language with Mosiah.  Chronologically, Mosiah’s desire that the land “be a land of liberty” is interesting.  That phrase, used in connection with the abolishment of kingship among the Nephites reminds the reader of Jacob’s earlier discourse against kings who rise up against God and Zion that the land may “be a land of liberty” (Mosiah 29:32). Mosiah had the small plates of Nephi, which recorded this teaching of Jacob, in his possession.  These words suggest that as he pondered the changes in the Nephite political system and the future of his people, the record and fate of the Jaredites may have been on Mosiah’s mind and that he may have also been influenced by Jacob’s earlier teachings.<br/><br/>Mosiah spoke of the “trails and troubles of a righteous king, yea, all the travails of soul for their people, and all the murmurings of the people to their king” (Mosiah 29:33).  Mosiah, who spoke from personal experience, used words that reflect the task of one who often had to make such decisions.  He also seems to have been one who drew upon Divine guidance to make difficult decisions, including the scriptures.</p>

      <p>Nephi was the son of Helaman II and the great grandson of the prophet Alma II.  He became the chief judge over the people of Nephi following the death of his father (Helaman 3:37).  During his reign there was a serious war with the Lamanites in which the Nephites lost the land of Zarahemla and most of their possessions in the land southward (Helaman 4:5-10).  They had, at this time, fallen into a state of serious apostasy (Helaman 4:11-26).  It was during this time that Nephi, following the precedent of his great grandfather Alma, yielded up his office as chief judge and devoted the remainder of his life to the ministry (Helaman 5:1-3).<br/><br/>  During his ministry, Nephi and his brother boldly went to the land of Zarahemla, then in enemy hands, and preached to Lamanites and Nephite dissenters, leading to the conversion of thousands (Helaman 5:17-19).  They then went up to the land of Nephi to preach where they were imprisoned, nearly put to death, but miraculously delivered through Divine intervention (Helaman 5:20-52).  This event was the catalyst for the remarkable conversion of many of the Lamanites.<br/><br/>  Following a lengthy mission in the land northward, Nephi returned to the land of Zarahemla to again find the Nephites in a state of gross apostasy, and the government in possession of a faction of the Gadianton robbers (Helaman 7:1-6).  He prophesied that the Nephites would be destroyed if they did not repent and announced the murder of the chief judge as a sign of that destruction (Helaman 8:27-28).  He then, through the gift of prophecy, revealed the identity of the secret murderer (Helaman 9:26-38).<br/><br/> Due to his faithfulness, the Lord blessed Nephi with the sealing power (Helaman 10:4-10).  He continued to preach and prophesy as wars increased among his unrepentant people (Helaman 10:12-18).  At his request, the Lord caused a famine to replace the destruction caused by war and after the people repented, the Lord, at his request brought an end to the famine (Helaman 11:1-17).<br/><br/>He continued to preach and baptize until shortly before the birth of Christ (Helaman 16:4-5), at which time he entrusted his son Nephi III with the sacred records and departed out of the land and like Alma, was never seen again among the people of Nephi (3 Nephi 1:2-3; 2:9).<br/><br/>Nephi’s reference to the Nephite refusal to lay of “treasures in heaven” (Helaman 8:25) recalls the words of his father Helaman who taught his sons to “lay up for yourselves a treasure in heaven, yea which is eternal, and which fadeth not away” (Helaman 5:8).<br/><br/>The “good shepherd” is used only 8 times in the Book of Mormon.  Nephi is one of only two speakers to use that term.  Nephi’s favorite word to use and the word he uses most often is “behold.”  He uses it to direct his audiences’ attention to the points he is making in his discourse, as when he announces the surprising death of the chief judge, “Yea, behold it [Nephite destruction] is now eve at your doors …” He asks the wicked Nephites, “Why will <strong><em>ye</em></strong> die?” (Helaman 7:17), and then announces the murder of the chief judge, providing a concrete example of the fate that awaits them (Helaman 8:27).  Nephi uses the phrase “except ye shall repent” 3 times, while it is used only two more times in the rest of the Book of Mormon.<br/><br/>Only Nephi uses the words “appeased,” “brazen,” “doors,” “examine,” “heaping,” “hurl,” “heaping,” “Israelites,” “joyed,” “paleness,” “parted,” “skirts.”<br/><br/>Nephi’s use of vivid words and images to describe impending destruction is notable, as in when he says that the devil is seeking to hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and endless woe” (Helaman 7:16).  The image is that of being violently thrown over a cliff.  In another example he addresses the wicked Nephites who are seeking gain through wickedness by reversing the image of piling up riches into a mound of self-destructive corruption that will be visible evidence of their abominations.<br/><br/>Even at this time, instead of <em>laying up</em> for yourselves <em>treasures</em> in heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and where nothing can come which is unclean, ye are <em>heaping up</em> for yourselves <em>wrath</em> against the day of judgment (Helaman 8:25).<br/><br/>Nephi also shows the ability to make object lessons out of the actions of his listeners.  As the people gather around him as he prays on the tower in his garden he asks, “why have ye <strong><em>gathered</em></strong> yourselves together?” (Helaman 7:13).  “And because of my mourning and lamentation ye have <strong><em>gathered</em></strong> yourselves together” (Helaman 7:15).  He then announces that “instead of <strong><em>gathering</em></strong> you” the good shepherd “shall <strong><em>scatter</em></strong> you forth that ye shall become meat for dogs and wild beasts” (Helaman 7:19).<br/><br/>As he defends himself from the accusation of being a false prophet, Nephi shows his familiarity with the Nephi’s scriptural heritage by appealing to no fewer than 9 prophets by name, and many other unnamed ones, who testified of Christ in just 7 verses.  He specifically names Moses, Abraham, Zenos, Zenock, Ezias, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lehi, and Nephi, but also appeals to “many” other before and after the time of Abraham (Helaman 8:16-22).  This shows his familiarity and confidence in citing scripture. The name “Zarahemla” appears to be a Hebrew name that means “seed” (<em>zera</em>) of compassion” (<em>hemla</em>).  In its verbal form <em>hemla</em> can also mean “to spare” or “to have mercy. ” It was the name of a descendant of Mulek, the only surviving son or seed of king Zedekiah of Judah who was spared when all the others were killed.  Nephi seems to make a wordplay when he tells the wicked of <strong><em>Zarahemla</em></strong> that while they will be destroyed if they fail to repent that “the Lord will be <strong><em>merciful</em></strong> unto them [the Lamanites!]; yea, he will lengthen out <strong><em>their</em></strong> days and increase <strong><em>their seed</em></strong> even when <strong><em>thou</em></strong> shalt be utterly destroyed except thou repent” (Helaman 7:24).<br/><br/>Nephi’s words show him to be a remarkable teacher who could effectively verbalize creative images.  His words conveyed rhetorical power by making use of objects, ideas, and actions, familiar to his hearers, and linking them to a message of repentance which they could not easily ignore.</p>

      <p>Nephi is the fourth Son of Lehi and Sariah, having at least eight siblings including Laman, Lemuel, Sam, Jacob, and Joseph. While traveling to land of promise, Nephi’s support of the Lord’s revelations to his father and his determination to be obedient to God often brings him into conflict with his oldest two brothers, Laman and Lemuel. Nephi is both a religious and political leader. He has many of his own visions and revelations. After the death of Lehi, the family divides. Those who are willing to hearken to the commandments of God become Nephites, choosing to follow Nephi. Nephi’s words on the small plates (1 Nephi and 2 Nephi) share an account of his family’s journey through the wilderness, and some of his visions, prophecies, and teachings.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, it is Nephi rather than Lehi who first uses the name Jesus Christ, a name that is revealed to him by an angel (1 Nephi 12:18 Original manuscript; 2 Nephi 25:19). Like his younger brother Jacob who shares his appreciation for the writings of Isaiah, Nephi frequently uses the title “Holy One of Israel” (10 times). Among Book of Mormon speakers, this title is only used by prophets on the small plates.<br/><br/>In the introduction to the account of his own visions, Nephi cites a prophecy of his father concerning the baptism of the “Lamb of God” (1 Nephi 10:10). Nephi’s questions about his father’s teachings lead to a vision where an angel shows Nephi the Lamb’s future mission (1 Nephi 11-14). Aside from the angel himself, Nephi references Christ as the “Lamb” or “Lamb of God” more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon text (more than 22 times). This can be compared to Moroni (5 times), Alma (twice), Amulek (once), and Mormon (once).<br/><br/>The revelations Nephi receives prove significant in his writings. Nephi uses the adjective great most frequently to refer to “great things” almost always in reference to things which are revealed or done by God, as well as what he has personally witnessed.<br/><br/>In addition to the teachings of his father and his own revelations from God, Nephi seems to be inspired by the records on the plates of brass. He mentions his delight in the scriptures and using them to persuade others to believe in Christ and his mission (2 Nephi 4:15-16; 11:4). He has a particular fondness of Isaiah’s prophecies, although the writings of Moses, Zenos, Zenock, and Neum are also mentioned (1 Nephi 19:10-23).<br/><br/>In contrast to other writers in the text, Nephi has a marked preference for the words “my father” (99), “beheld” (77), “angel” (45), “my brethren” (62), and “plates” (52). Nephi’s word choice suggests the great influence that heavenly messengers, the scriptures, and family have in his life. Nephi uses the term “Lamanites.” However, unlike subsequent writers, he never refers to his own people as the Nephites. Instead, he refers to them as “my people”.<br/><br/>Among writers and speakers in the Book of Mormon, Nephi alone uses the phrases “the seed of my brethren” (12), “representation” (5), “the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass” (4), “the remnant of our seed” (4), and “treasury” (4). The phrase “wars and rumors of wars” (4) is used exclusively by Nephi (4).<br/><br/>Nephi’s preference to “plainness” (2 Nephi 31:3) underscores his bold, uncompromising, and forthright style. His closing words sound a triumphant tone, “I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from hell.” He optimistically looks forward to meeting many souls who are spotless before the judgment seat of God (2 Nephi 33:6-7). “Nephi’s farewell strikes a dominant chord and is accompanied by timpani rolls and cymbal clashes” in contrast to his brother Jacob who “ends quietly and in a minor key.” While both Nephi and Jacob speak boldly, Nephi seems less concerned with offending the sensibilities of others.<br/><br/><strong>So, when reading Nephi’s record</strong>, make sure to pay attention to his use of the words and phrase “Lamb”, “great”, and “my people.”</p>

      <p>Pahoran was the son of Nephi and was the third Chief Judge over the Nephites (Alma 50:39-40).  He reigned during a significant period of war between the Nephites and the Lamanites. Based upon the text he appears to have been a righteous man. During his reign a significant faction of the people known as “kingmen” agitated to change the law to allow kings instead of judges which Pahoran rightly did not allow (Alma 51:1-7). This faction continued to cause problems for the Nephites, sometimes refusing to take up arms in defense of the land (Alma 51:13-20) and at other times openly seeking the overthrow of the Nephite government. Pahoran and his supporters known as “freemen” were temporarily driven out of the city of Zarahemla by the kingmen faction led by Pachus and had to take refuge in the land of Gideon (Alma 61:8). While in possession of Zarahemla, the Pachus faction denied support to the armies of Moroni and Helaman resulting in the loss of the city of Nephihah and the massacre of many of its people (Alma 59:1-11). Moroni, unaware of the kingmen’s coup initially blamed Pahoran for these difficulties in a pointed letter to the chief judge (Alma 60), but soon became appraised of the true situation from an epistle from Pahoran (Alma 61:1-21). By joining forces with those of Moroni, the chief judge was able to defeat the army of Pachus and be restored to the judgement seat (Alma 62:1-10). His restoration to the judgement seat, and the renewal of support for the Nephite armies helped bring a rapid end to the war.<br/><br/>Pahoran’s words are found in his single epistle to Captain Moroni. They portray a man concerned about fulfilling his duty, grieved about the rebellion against his rule, the suffering of his people, but also one who may not have been entirely sure of how to respond to a perplexing situation (Alma 61:19). It also shows him to be a man of humility who was not provoked by Moroni’s misdirected threats and accusations.<br/><br/>Pahoran and Moroni are the only Book of Mormon speakers to share the phrase “spirit of freedom.” He also is the only one to use the words and phrases “risen up,” “avenge our wrongs,” “God hath made them free,” “God hath made us free,” “great flattery,” “rebellions and dissensions,” “subject ourselves, “alliance,” “censured,” “daunted,” “flocking,” and “grieves.”<br/><br/>Pahoran uses the words “risen up” (as in rebelled), “resist,” “rebellions” more frequently than in the rest of the Book of Mormon. This is clearly the distinguishing topic of his letter. All other occurrences of “risen up” in the Book of Mormon refer to the resurrection of the dead.<br/><br/>Pahoran refers to “freemen,” “freedom,” “free,” and “liberty” at a higher rate than other Book of Mormon speakers. Only he and Alma use the phrase “requisite with the justice of God.”<br/><br/> The phrase “standfast in the liberty wherewith God hath made them/us free” seems to have been a phrase which was first used by Alma I in the Land of Helam when his people wanted to make that prophet a king.<br/><br/>And now I say unto you, ye have been oppressed by king Noah, and have been in bondage to him and his priests, and have been brought into iniquity by them; therefore ye were bound with the bands of iniquity. And now as ye have been delivered by the power of God out of these bonds; yea, even out of the hands of king Noah and his people, and also from the bonds of inquity, even so I desire that ye <strong><em>should stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free</em></strong>, and that ye trust no man to be a king over you (Mosiah 23:12-13). <br/><br/>This teaching which is also used by Helaman is rooted in the idea that kings and unrighteous leaders can lead their people into iniquity. King Mosiah’s abandonment of government by kingship for government by judges was based upon the Lord’s commandments (Mosiah 29:30) and the idea that unrighteous kingship would inevitably lead to serious iniquity was a defining issue for the Nephites during the reign of the judges (Mosiah 29:12-36). Pahoran’s uses of Alma’s phrase in his epistle signaled to Moroni that as chief judge he was committed to righteous government and the fulfillment of his oath (Alma 50:39) He opposed the efforts of the kingmen to replace it with kings because he knew that such would lead to bondage from sin as well as political bondage. Righteous government would help maintain liberty from sin available through Christ the Redeemer.<br/><br/>Pahoran’s words show that he was a righteous and humble leader, not easily provoked, but committed to maintaining righteous Nephite government so that the people might remain free from the bondage of unrighteous leaders and sin.<br/><br/></p>
