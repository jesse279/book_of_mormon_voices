Lehi was often directed by the Lord in dreams, and he also had many visions including a vision in which he saw the Lord, a vision of the Tree of Life, and a vision that revealed the destruction of Jerusalem. Lehi wrote a record of his life, dreams, and visions called the Book of Lehi which was included in the 116 lost manuscript pages of the Book of Mormon; fortunately, Lehi’s son, Nephi, included an abridgment of the Book of Lehi in his own record (1 Nephi 1:16-17; 10:1).\", fact: \"Did you know that Lehi is the only Book of Mormon prophet to refer to the Messiah as the great Mediator?\", img: \"none\"},\r\n    { name: \"Mormon\", link: \"mormon\", id: 12, year: \"310AD-390AD\", word_count: 97813, description: \"Mormon was so large in stature that the Nephites placed him as the commander of their armies when he was only sixteen years old (Mormon 2:1-2), and he continued to lead the armies of the Nephites off and on until the Nephites were finally defeated at Cumorah.

Mormon was entrusted with the sacred records of the Nephites when he was ten years old, he was visited of the Lord when he was only fifteen, and he was eventually ordained as one of the Disciples of Jesus Christ (3 Nephi 5:13). Mormon lived after the final battle at Cumorah in about 385 AD long enough to write at least what now consists of Mormon 6-7, but sometime between the final battle and about 400 AD, Mormon was killed by the Lamanites, making Moroni the last surviving Nephite.\", fact: \"Did you know that when Mormon uses the adjective “great” the most common object is joy?\", img: \"none\"},\r\n    { name: \"Moroni, Son of Mormon\", link: \"moroni\", id: 13, year: \"340AD-425AD\", word_count: 19000, description: \"Moroni was very concerned that the Book of Mormon would be rejected by future generations, in particular because of the Nephites’ weakness in writing (Ether 12:23-25).

In addition to his words now contained in the Book of Mormon, Moroni wrote the vision of the Brother of Jared in the sealed portion of the plates, which reveals “all things from the foundation of the world unto the end thereof” (2 Nephi 27:10) and of which Moroni commented, “there never were greater things made manifest” (Ether 4:4-6).\", fact: \"Did you know that Moroni is the only Nephite prophet to use the name Jehovah?\", img: \"none\"},\r\n    { name: \"Mosiah\", link: \"mosiah\", id: 14, year: \"154BC-91BC\", word_count: 1178, description: \"Mosiah was not only a great Nephite king, but also a great prophet of God.
